### Multi-Function Color Display

With at least two standard on every aircraft, the Multi-Function Color Display
(MFCD) is your primary means of interaction with the aircraft's systems. While
newer aircraft like the [F-45A](#f-45a) use a more intuitive touch-screen MFCD,
most use a standard MFCD with hardware buttons arrayed along the sides.

Using a hardware-button MFCD is quite straightforward. The important data will
be generally shown in the center of the display, and labels will be positioned
adjacent to the buttons. If there is no label next to a button, pressing that
button will have no effect.

#### Sensor of Interest

Some MFCD screens can be made the Sensor of Interest (SOI). If an MFCD screen
has this capability, the upper-right-most button will be labeled SOI. Pressing
this button will cause the display to be surrounded with a green rectangle to
indicate that it is SOI, and any other screen that was previously SOI will no
longer be (there can be only one SOI at a time). When SOI, the
touchpad/thumbstick of the right controller can be used to control the sensor
in a context-dependent way:

Page | Touchpad/thumbstick use
:-|:-
NAV | Scroll the map
TGP/EOTS | Change the camera angle
TSD, RADAR | Move the cursor and highlight targets; click to select. (RADAR: click a second time to lock)
