## F-45A

The F-45A is a new aircraft currently in development on the `public_testing`
branch. It appears to be largely based on the [F-35 Lightning II][f-35].

### Distinguishing Features

* Stealth frame is harder for radar systems to detect
* Enclosed weapons bay that only opens for launch minimizes radar cross section
* Thrust vectoring for vertial take-off and landing
* Four touch-screen [MFCDs][mfcd].
* [Tactual Situation Display][tsd]
