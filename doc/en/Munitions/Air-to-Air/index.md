### Employment

#### Heat-Seeking

Heat-seeking missiles generally have similar methods of employment. After
selecting the weapon, you'll have a big circle in the middle of your HUD, and
you'll hear a low growling through your headset. This represents the missile's
seeker head. The basic principle is to put your target inside this circle,
wait for the growl to change into a high-pitch screech, and squeeze the
trigger.

Both missiles have a few different modes of target acquisition to help you get
your target inside the circle. As with any other configurable weapon, this can
be found by accessing the EQUIP page of the MFD, setting the mode to CONFIG,
and selecting one of the lines indicating the appropriate weapon.

The different targeting modes and their descriptions are:

Mode          | Description
--------------|------------
Caged         | The default mode; the targeting cue is locked to the middle of the HUD
Uncaged       | The targeting cue wanders around the middle of the HUD
Vertical Scan | The cue scans up and down the middle of the HUD
Head Track    | The cue follows the motion of your head.

> **NOTE**: When using Head Track mode, make sure you've enabled HMCS power and lowered
> your HMCS visor!
