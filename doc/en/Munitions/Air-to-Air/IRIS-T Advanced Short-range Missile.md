#### IRIS-T Advanced Short Range Missile

A short range, heat-seeking missile with advanced capabilities. While nearly
twice the price of a Sidewinder, if you can afford the IRIS-T it will rarely
let you down!  With improved maneuverability, range, and a
counter-countermeasure system, the IRIS-T is perfect for swatting pesky enemy
aircraft when you've got better things to do than engage in dogfights.

*Cost*: $1500 / missile
*Mass*: 123kg
