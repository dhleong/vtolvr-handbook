### Avoiding Missiles

We've all been there. You're cruising along, minding your own business, when
suddenly the missile launch warning goes off. The key to surviving these
encounters is to stay calm and analyze the situation.

Orange Light | "Fox" on Radio | Situation
:-|:-|:-
*no* | Yes  | *Probably*, an ally has launched a missile
Yes  | *no* | You've been targetted by an active radar-guided missile
*no* | *no* | You've been targetted by a heat-seeking missile

If a call such as "Fox 2" (infrared-guided) or "Fox 3" (active radar-guided)
is accompanied by a missile warning, and you don't see an orange warning
light, as indicated above this missile is *probably* an ally's aimed at
somebody else, but you should still be wary.

Properly identifying the type of threat is crucial to survival, as some
evasion techniques are mutually exclusive, as you will see.

#### Active radar-guided missiles

Flares and other countermeasures will generally not help too much against
these. Instead, the general strategy is to force the incoming missile to
expend all of its energy before it can reach you. Two common maneuvers
for accomplishing this are covered below.

##### F-Pole Maneuver

TK

##### Beaming

TK


#### Heat-seeking missiles

Infrared/Heat-seeking missiles like the [AIM-9](#AIM-9-Sidewinder) are
sometimes simpler to avoid than active radar-guided. Using the techniques
above cannot hurt, of course—dogfighting tends to be about correct energy
management—however the fact that IR missiles can be confused by appropriate
use of Flares tends to make them somewhat easier to evade.

It is important to remember, however, that *flares are not magic*. They can
draw away IR-seeking missiles by providing a hotter-looking target for the
seeker head, but if your engines are still in full afterburner then they won't
be enough to distract the missile. If you are hoping to use Flares to evade an
IR-seeking missile, you *must* lower your throttle to put out a smaller IR
signature than your flares!
