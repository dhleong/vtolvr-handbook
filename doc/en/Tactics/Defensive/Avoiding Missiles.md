### Avoiding Missiles

We've all been there. You're cruising along, minding your own business, when
suddenly the missile launch warning goes off. The key to surviving these
encounters is to stay calm and analyze the situation.

When you get the "missile launched" notification, the things you need to pay
attention to are:

1. The orange "MISSILE" warning light
1. "Fox Two" or "Fox Three" calls on the radio (if flying with wingmen)

"MISSILE" | "Fox" | Situation
:-:|:-:|:-
*no* | "Fox Two" | *Probably*, an ally has launched an IR missile
Yes  | *none* | You've been targetted by an active radar-guided missile
*no* | *none* | You've been targetted by a heat-seeking missile

If a call such as "Fox 2" (infrared-guided) or "Fox 3" (active radar-guided)
is accompanied by a missile launch notification, and you don't see the orange
warning light, as indicated above this missile is *probably* an ally's aimed
at somebody else, but you should still be wary. A red `M` on the RWR is also a
good indication that you've been targetted by an active radar-guided missile.

Properly identifying the type of threat is crucial to survival, as some
evasion techniques are mutually exclusive, as you will see.

#### General Strategies

Situational awareness is crucial to survival. As soon as you get a "missile
launched" notification, you have a potentially very short window of time
before the missile locks onto you. In that window, it may be possible to
confuse the missile's tracking systems by launching countermeasures, but
it becomes much harder to do so once it has a lock (indicated by the orange
"MISSILE" warning light).

For radar-guided missiles, it may still be possible to confuse the missile
(see [Beaming](#beaming) below) but in general at this point your best bet
is to avoid it. Here, the things to remember are that:

1. The missile is trying to go where it thinks you *will be*, not where you
   are.
1. The missile has a finite amount of fuel and energy that it can use to reach
   you.

With that in mind, here are some general strategies:

- Don't run away from the missile—it will have the advantage in a direct
  chase. Instead, prefer flying perpendicular to it, if you can, or at
  an angle towards it, so it has to waste its energy maneuvering.
- Dive toward the ground, or a mountain, and fly low, to try to trick the
  missile into crashing into the ground.
- Alternatively, if you have enough speed, climb into the air to try to
  make the missile waste its energy following you, keeping in mind your
  angle with the missile.

#### Active radar-guided missiles

Flares will generally not help too much against these, and chaff is
situational. The general strategies of forcing the incoming missile to expend
all of its energy before it can reach you, as described above, are very
relevant. Two common maneuvers for accomplishing this are covered below.

##### F-Pole Maneuver

F-Pole refers to the distance between the launching aircraft and its target at
the moment of missile impact[^fpole]. An F-Pole maneuver is a BVR[^bvr]
strategy designed to maximize this distance, with the idea that by engaging
bandits[^bandit] at a longer range you are more likely to stay out of their
engagement zone and, consequently, more likely to survive the
encounter.[^fpole2]

The prototypical example of the F-Pole maneuver involves an enemy aircraft on
a head-on trajectory towards your aircraft. In this situation, it is
recommended to "crank" left or right of the aircraft so that your flight path
is about a level 40-50 degrees away from theirs (you probably want to turn in
the direction of the shorter angle, to conserve energy. As they continue to
approach, even if they adjust course to try to intercept, any radar-guided
missile they launch will have to make a hard turn to try to intercept you.

If they do launch a missile, you can then abuse its guidance systems by
turning in towards the enemy aircraft, probably about a 90-100 degree turn in
the opposite direction of your original turn. At this point, you will be in a
good position to launch a missile of your own, as you will have closed more
distance and, by keeping the enemy within 50 degrees of you, you should still
have a radar lock on them. This sharp turn will force the incoming missile
to waste even more energy on a second turn, hopefully making it easy for you
to avoid (if it's fully active, or if it's semi-active but your missile doesn't
take out the enemy aircraft before the missile gets close enough to intercept
you).

##### Beaming

The way doppler radar tracking works, if you are moving toward or away from
the radar site it will very easily be able to detect you against the open sky.
When beaming, you maintain a perpendicular flight path to the line of site
from the radar site, so that you are neither moving towards nor away from it,
making it harder for the missile to distinguish you from the landscape.

If the missile is launched at you from above (IE another aircraft) then
beaming the missile may be sufficient to make it unable to distinguish you
from the terrain. If it was launched from below you, however, such as from a
surface-mounted missile launcher, you will need to make use of chaff.

While maintaining a perpendicular flight path to the radar site, particularly
as the missile approaches your aircraft, begin launching a slow but steady
stream of chaff. Hopefully this will confuse the missile and it will break off.
If it does not, you may need to switch strategies.

It is important to remember that once you have established a perpendicular
flight path, you will need to bank slightly towards the radar site so that you
are orbiting it, in order to maintain the perpendicular path; otherwise, you
will start to flight away from the radar site, and you will no longer be
beaming.


#### Heat-seeking missiles

Infrared/Heat-seeking missiles like the [AIM-9](#aim-9-sidewinder) are
sometimes simpler to avoid than active radar-guided. Using the techniques
above cannot hurt, of course—dogfighting tends to be about correct energy
management—however the fact that IR missiles can be confused by appropriate
use of Flares tends to make them somewhat easier to evade.

It is important to remember, however, that *flares are not magic*. They can
draw away IR-seeking missiles by providing a hotter-looking target for the
seeker head, but if your engines are still in full afterburner then they won't
be enough to distract the missile. If you are hoping to use Flares to evade an
IR-seeking missile, you *must* lower your throttle to put out a smaller IR
signature than your flares!
